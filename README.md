This project provides a comprehensive list of auto-generated iCloud Private Relay egress IP addresses in various formats (iptables ipset, JSON, and TXT) for easy integration into your network infrastructure.

## What is iCloud Private Relay?

[iCloud Private Relay](https://developer.apple.com/support/prepare-your-network-for-icloud-private-relay) is a privacy-focused feature offered by Apple Inc. It enhances the security and privacy of your internet connections by providing an additional layer of encryption and anonymity when browsing the web. This feature routes your internet traffic through two separate servers, making it difficult for anyone, including Apple, to identify your IP address or the websites you visit.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository aims to provide an up-to-date and automatically generated (from [original IP feed](https://mask-api.icloud.com/egress-ip-ranges.csv)) list of iCloud Private Relay egress IP addresses in various formats. By using these IP address lists, you can easily integrate iCloud Private Relay support into your network infrastructure, such as firewalls, proxy servers, or load balancers.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


- **ip-ranges.ipset**: IP address list in `ipset` format containing both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- **ip-ranges.json**: IP address list in JSON format containing both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- **ip-ranges.txt**: IP address list in plain text format containing both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- **ipv4**: Subdirectory containing IPv4-specific IP address lists.
    - **ipv4-ranges.ipset**: IP address list in `ipset` format containing only IPv4 addresses.
    - **ipv4-ranges.json**: IP address list in JSON format containing only IPv4 addresses.
    - **ipv4-ranges.txt**: IP address list in plain text format containing only IPv4 addresses.
- **ipv6**: Subdirectory containing IPv6-specific IP address lists.
    - **ipv6-ranges.ipset**: IP address list in `ipset` format containing only IPv6 addresses.
    - **ipv6-ranges.json**: IP address list in JSON format containing only IPv6 addresses.
    - **ipv6-ranges.txt**: IP address list in plain text format containing only IPv6 addresses.
- **geo_country**: Subdirectory containing segmented geolocalized information by country with the same content scheme that the full list

## How to Use

You can use any of the provided IP address lists based on your network infrastructure requirements. For example:

- If you use iptables with ipset, you can use the `ip-ranges.ipset` or the appropriate IPv4/IPv6 specific `ipset` files.
- For programmatic access, you may prefer the JSON format (`ip-ranges.json` or specific IPv4/IPv6 JSON files).
- The plain text format (`ip-ranges.txt` or specific IPv4/IPv6 text files) can be handy for manual configuration or quick reference.

## Updates and Maintenance

This repository is automatically updated at regular intervals to ensure the IP address lists remain up-to-date with the latest iCloud Private Relay egress IP addresses. The update process involves querying official sources and automated validation to provide accurate and reliable information.
